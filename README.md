Our app and website will help the people who are in a new city to decide where to visit with the time they have in hand. We will first get the user’s current location and using this, we will set a certain search radius, within which the user can look for the type of places they want to visit, such as restaurants, monuments, shops, and so on. The app will then generate an itinerary for the user by analysing the user’s selections and will also show the shortest route possible that covers all the places so that the user doesn’t waste time or money by taking a longer route. We will also provide an option for the user to rent a cab so that they can travel hassle free.
